# dotfiles
Here are my dotfiles ( (always) work-in-progress).
This is meant to support only OpenSUSE with Hyprland for now.
QMK has also some configuration, but is only needed for custom keyboards.

## Installation
To link the config files, run:
```
make link-home
make link-conf
```

To add the shell config to .bashrc, run:
```
make shell
```

To set up git, run:
```
make git
```

To install the FiraCode font, run:
```
make fonts
```

To install tpm run:
```
make tmux
```
Plugins can be installed with tpm by pressing <leader>+I within tmux.

## Wallpapers
A collection of wallpapers can be found on the wallpaper branch.
